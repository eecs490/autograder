# autograder

This repository implements an autograder for Rust, intended to interface with the Gradescope autograding infrastructure.
Specifically, it contains Dockerfiles that set up the development environment necessary for running rust code
and a file `run_autograder`.
Upon receiving a submission, Gradescope

1. creates a docker container
2. copies the student's submission into the container
3. executes `./run_autograder`.

Gradescope acquires the image for the container from dockerhub. In the image it
runs some unspecified proprietary Gradescope magic code that copies the
submission and messes with the environment variables üò©

## Release vs. Dev

There are two images that I have been using:

- `rust-autograder`: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker//ethanabrooks/rust-autograder/
- `rust-autograder-dev`: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ethanabrooks/rust-autograder-dev/

These correspond to the two Dockerfiles, `Dockerfile`, and `Dockerfile.dev`. We refer to the first as the "release" version and the second as the "dev" version.

There are two ways to send files to Gradescope:
1. In the docker image published to dockerhub.
2. In the submission submitted by the student.
Building an image and pushing to dockerhub is very slow. To speed things up, the dev version assumes that the submission will include the `assignment/` directory instead of looking for it in the original docker image. However, the `assignment/` directory includes logic that we do not want students to see (e.g. the solution to problems). Therefore the release version assumes that the `assignment/` directory will already exist in the docker image. Also, the release version builds the submission in advance so that grading is quicker for actual students.

The intended development workflow is to do all the work with the dev version and 
and only switch to release once development is finished and we are ready to release the assignment.

# Getting started

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ethanabrooks/autograder.git
cd autograder
```

## Building the docker image

### dev version

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t ethanabrooks/rust-autograder-dev .
```

### release version

```bash
docker build -t ethanabrooks/rust-autograder .
```

## Running the docker image locally

### dev version

```bash
docker run --rm -it --name running-autograder ethanabrooks/rust-autograder-dev /bin/bash
```

From outside the image, run

```bash
docker cp ~/autograder/autograder running-autograder:/autograder/submission
```

This simulates the copying of the submission into the docker image.
From inside the image, run

```bash
./run_autograder
```

### release version

```bash
docker run --rm -it --name running-autograder ethanabrooks/rust-autograder /bin/bash
```

From outside the image, run

```bash
docker cp ~/autograder/autograder/submission running-autograder:/autograder/submission
```

This simulates the copying of the submission into the docker image.
From inside the image, run

```bash
./run_autograder
```

## Updating the dockerhub image

Note that in order to update the dockerhub image, you will need a dockerhub
account, which you can register for [here](https://hub.docker.com/signup).

### dev version

```bash
docker push ethanabrooks/rust-autograder-dev
```

### release version

```bash
docker push ethanabrooks/rust-autograder
```

## Submitting to Gradescope

The first step is to create an assignment zip file. The dev version allows you
to submit the grading/assignment logic with the submission, allow the developer
to make changes without needing to update the dockerhub image.

### dev version

For this version, we zip all three directories. From the root of the project:

```bash
cd autograder
zip -r submission.zip **/Cargo.* **/src/ -x '*/\target/*'
```

### release version

For this version, we only zip the `submission/` directory. From the root of the
project:

```bash
cd autograder/submission/
zip -r submission.zip **/Cargo.* **/src/ -x '*/\target/*'
```

### Submitting to Gradescope

1. Go to https://www.gradescope.com/courses/78826/assignments/355815/configure_autograder.
2. Check the "Manual Docker Configuration" checkbox.
3. In the **DOCKERHUB IMAGE NAME** field, write
   - `ethanabrooks/rust-autograder-dev` for the dev version.
   - `ethanabrooks/rust-autograder` for the release version.
4. Click "Update Autograder" (lower right of the screen)
5. Click "Test Autograder" (lower right of the screen)
6. Upload the zip file we made earlier
   - `autograder/submission.zip` for dev.
   - `autograder/submission/submission.zip` for release.
7. (Optional) Click the "‚ùØ\_ Debug via SSH". After a minute or two, Gradescope will spit out an ssh command -- something like

```
ssh root@ec2-34-216-119-27.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com -p 32790
```

If you run this on your terminal, you can poke around in the container that Gradescope is using to run the autograder. To reproduce what Gradescope actually does, run `./run_autograder`. This should produce a file at `/autograder/results/results.json`. The content of this file should match the output format specified here: https://gradescope-autograders.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specs/#output-format.

# Guide to the autograder

At a high level, the autograder

1. runs `cargo test` on the student's submission and on the `assignment` package.
2. scrapes the output and parses into `rust` `TestResult` structs.
3. creates a `TestReport` struct and writes the associated json object to the location where Gradescope looks for it.

A good place to start with the source code is `assignment/src/main.rs`. For details on how Gradescope works with this, read https://github.com/ethanabrooks/autograder/blob/master/README.md.
